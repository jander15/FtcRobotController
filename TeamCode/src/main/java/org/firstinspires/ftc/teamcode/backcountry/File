//command type {double Speed, double Direction, double Distance, double Angle, double Time}
Speed from -1.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 being 100% speed and -1.0 being 100% in reverce.
Direction is used in OBM to diside wich way the motor rotates.
Distance is in cm as a double so 12.0 or 1.0 must include .0 or a single decimle place
Angle only used in reotations and this is used with triginometry in a lower leavle to calculate how far the moter have to rotate.

//newOBM motorName
creates new OBM
//motorName{double Speed, double Direction, double Distance, double Angle, double Time}
uses OBM

all perameters must be filled out but if not needed for the command or task leave a zero.
command type examples are StraitMotion, Rotate, Strafe

newOBM creates a new motor to be used and OBM stands for on bot mechanich

examples

//StraitMotion{1.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0}
Moves robot 20 cm at 100% speed.
